I see people complaining about video games not boing what they used to be: They were finished at launch, they tried new things, they weren't full of micro transactions and/or game passes. The thing is though, those games still exist! They're just not made by the large game development studios.

If you want to play a good Battlefield, play [Battlebit Remastered](https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/). It's not only better at giving you the same big battle feeling, it's a quarter of the price!

Or if you want to try something a bit different: how about a reverse city builder? [Terra Nil](https://www.gog.com/en/game/terra_nil) ([also on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593030/Terra_Nil/)) sets you the task of restoring plant and animal life before leaving the planet, not leaving a trace.

Or if you want an actual city builder, but it's all about chilling and creating beautiful cities, give [Townscaper](https://www.gog.com/en/game/townscaper) ([also on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291340/Townscaper/)) a try. Sit back and build to your heart's content...

Maybe you're more in the mood for a singleplayer diving experience like [Dave the Diver](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/). You're able to live out your fantasy of combining deep sea diving and running a sushi restaurant, just like you always wanted.

If you like the sea, but not diving, how about giving [Dredge](https://www.gog.com/en/game/dredge) ([also on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562430/DREDGE/)) a go? Go fishing in your small boat, upgrade your equipment and avoid whatever horrors are in the ocean.

If you're into to puzzles and thought Portal was a pretty good game, then maybe [Viewfinder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382070/Viewfinder/) is up your ally. What if Portal, but more mind bending?

Or if you're more into bending others' minds: [Cult of the Lamb](https://www.gog.com/en/game/cult_of_the_lamb) ([also on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1313140/Cult_of_the_Lamb/))! You're running a cult, and your followers are almost too cute.

And finally. If you were a bit disappointed by Starfield, maybe give [The Outer Worlds](https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_outer_worlds) ([also on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/578650/The_Outer_Worlds/)) a shake. It's an RPG, in space, but with a glint in it's eye. The studio is somewhat bigger than the others on the list, but it's Obsidian. They just know how to make a fun RPG.

Go play some fun games, and support smaller developers while doing it!
