I'm going to embark on my most controversial blog post yet, but it's been on my
mind a lot lately, and I have to get it out.

I think gender quotas are necessary.

I'm not saying they're a good thing, but I think they're a necessary evil in a
society that can't get it's shit toghether and treat both sexes equally. I an
ideal world, it wouldn't be necessary, but so wouldn't laws against taking stuff
that's not yours, but here we are.

One of the most common arguments I hear against this is that better qualified
people (most often men, but also women) will be passed over because of the quota
requirement. To this I have to responses.

The quota is forcing persons who might be biased against picking people of the
minority gender. In their eyes they'll have to pick the best among that inferior
group. In reality, you'll end up with a person more qualified than the one that
would usually get the position.

If you however do not end up with a more qualified person, then the problem is
not the quota, it's your hiring practices. Why are there so few qualified people
in the minority gender in the first place?

Long term, the quota will lead to a new generation of workers who are used to
seeing a more even representation of the genders in different positions. Just as
we've become used to new ideas by being exposed to them from an early age, the
quota will help shape a more fair future. At least that's what I hope.

The quota is a necessary evil for now, but hopefully we won't need it in the
future.
