I’ve always been bugged by the fact that the date format on the Windows 10 lock
screen didn’t match with my region’s date format. As a Norwegian I prefer the
sensible date format used in Norway (and most of Europe), but also to use
American English as the display language.

The lock screen, the image that you see on your screen before you log in, didn’t
use the correct format. Sure it was correct if I logged in and locked the
computer, but not when doing a reboot for instance.

Today I decided to figure this one out. And as it turns out; it’s not that
difficult (if you’re somewhat used to rummaging around in Windows’
Settings/Control Panel).

To set the preferred date format (and region) for your lock screen, do this:

 1. Open Settings  app
 2. Click on Time & Language
 3. Scroll down on the right hand side and click on Additional date, time &
    regional settings
 4. Click on Region
 5. Click on Administrative
 6. Click on Copy settings...
 7. Select Welcome screen and system accounts
 8. Click on OK

This will copy your current preferences to be used as the default for the lock
screen (or welcome screen as it’s called here) and system accounts.

I’ve even made a nice GIF if that’s your sort of thing:
