With the introduction of C# 6 there are now two types of automatic getter only properties:

```
public List<string> OldAndFamiliar { get; } = new[] { "Old", "and", "familiar" }.ToList();

public List<string> NewHotness => new[] { "New", "hotness" }.ToList();
```

They might look very similar, and in this case they will also return the same result. Under the covers, though, they are different.

*Automatic properties*  in C# are defined by using `get;` and/or `set;`:

```
public string AutoProperty { get; set; }
```

The compiler will automatically generate a backing field and a getter and setter. Something akin this:

```
private List<string> autoProperty;
public List<string> AutoProperty
{
    get { return autoProperty; }
    set { autoProperty = value; }
}
```

You might have written something like this a lot of times when programming in C#.

Considering how automatic properties are generated by the compiler, it's now easier to understand how the two different getter only properties work.

The `OldAndFamiliar` version will become something akin to this:

```
private List<string> oldAndFamiliar = new[] { "Old", "and", "familiar" }.ToList();
public List<string> OldAndFamiliar 
{
    get { return oldAndFamiliar ; }
}
```

While the `NewHotness` version will become something akin to this:

```
public List<string> NewHotness
{
    get { return new[] { "New", "hotness" }.ToList(); }
}
```

As you can see, `OldAndFamiliar` will only asign the `List<string>` once (to the backing field). `NewHotness` will return a new `List<string>` every time.

The `NewHotness` version acts like a method, but it looks like a property. These are more or less the same:

```
public List<string> NewHotness => new[] { "New", "hotness" }.ToList();
public List<string> GetNewHotness() => new[] { "New", "hotness" }.ToList();
```

When to use which, is up to you and your use case.

Happy coding!
