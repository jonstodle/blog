There's a thoroughly well hidden feature in Firefox that lets you assign text shortcuts to your bookmarks. Typing the shortcut in the address bar will launch your bookmark. As I mentioned though, it's very hidden within Firefox, but here's how to do it.

Bookmark a page by clicking the star icon to the right in the address bar.

Click the menu button all the way to the right and select **Library**

Click **Show all bookmarks** at the bottom

Search for the correct bookmark in the search field (1) and select the bookmark (2). Expand the bottom panel by clicking the arrow in the lower left corner of the panel (3).

Enter your preferred text shortcut in the **Keyword** field.

The shortcut can now be used like this:
